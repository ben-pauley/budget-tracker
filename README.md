# Workout Tracker

## My Repository

In this GitHub repository, you will find my budget tracker web application, which is available online and offline. The purpose of this application is to allow users to keep track of their finances, even when they're unable to find an internet connection. It was developed with the use of service workers, caching data and indexedDB.

## Installation

This application does not need to be installed, as it can be viewed live on Heroku at the following URL. [https://bjp-budget-tracker.herokuapp.com](https://bjp-budget-tracker.herokuapp.com)

## Screenshots of Deployed Application

## Software Used

The development of this project was completed using Visual Studio Code, with MongoDB Robo3T to view the database and collections on my local machine, and then MongoDB Atlas to deploy the application on Heroku.

## Conclusion

I found it very valuable to be able to create an application with offline functionality, and although it was confusing at first, I was glad to be able to achieve an end result that I'm satisfied with.
